# domarchy (Dockerized Omarchy)

Beautiful, Modern & Opinionated Dockerized Linux. This repo exists primarily as a personal sandbox for testing and developing Omarchy configuration scripts in a fully isolated environment. It also aims to make Omarchy accessible to anyone who wants to try it without committing to a full installation or dual boot setup.

## Getting Started

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Connect to the VM display:

```bash
vncviewer -fullscreen localhost:5900
```

**N.B.** On the first run you will be greeted by the Omarchy installer. Complete the installation manually before using the system. Subsequent starts will boot directly into Omarchy.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

When running domarchy inside Omarchy, keyboard shortcuts will be intercepted by the host. To forward all shortcuts to the container, add the following to your host's Hyprland config:

```bash
nvim ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
```

Add at the bottom:

```
bind = SUPER, F10, submap, passthrough
submap = passthrough
bind = SUPER, F10, submap, reset
submap = reset
```

Then reload Hyprland:

```bash
omarchy-restart-hyprctl
```

Now press `Super + F10` to toggle keyboard passthrough to the container.
